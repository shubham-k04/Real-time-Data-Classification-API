Classification Rules: 

1. count of (a) >= 5
2. max of (count of (a), count of (b)) < 9
3. min of (count of (cc), count of (av)) = 2
4. sum of (count of (e), count of (z), count of (y)) > 6
5. sum of (max of (count of (a), count of (b)), min of (count of (c), count of (d))) = 10
6. max of (count of (a), count of (b)) >= min of (count of (t), count of (r))
7. product of (count of (a), count of (b)) = 16
